# Chromisery

Chromisery is a community-driven fork of Chromis, built because the original project doesn't currently accept
contributions or provide its source code as required by its GPLv3 license. Chromisery uses the latest available Chromis
source (git rev 5a4a517) and aims to be a truly open-source alternative, ready to contribute back upstream in the spirit
of open source when the original project is open to collaboration.

## Project Focus

The current focus of Chromisery is to work on tooling and workflow, streamlining the build and testing process,
and the release process before working on features and fixes.

## Sponsorship

This work is sponsored by [Kokkos Cafe Ltd](https://kokkoscafe.com).
